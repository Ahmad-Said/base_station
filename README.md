# Site Solution Configurator for Mobile Base Station

## Project Scope

For an international telecommunication company, the team will develop an application (for Windows) allowing the users (engineers, salespersons, customers, etc.) to configure a mobile base station site (2G/3G/4G/5G).

## Project description

For a mobile base station site (2G/3G/4G/5G), the application shall take as inputs the required telecommunication systems, used frequencies, used technologies, etc. and then the application shall do some basic calculations and look up in a database in order to select the correct products satisfying the site configuration provided by the user.
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) shall allow the user to enter the inputs parameters. Then it shall provide the bill of material (BOM) in terms of product name/model and quantity.
The GUI shall also provide a schematic drawing of the base station site tower showing the selected products connected together as it should be.
The database could be localized on the PC or distributed over the cloud. The choice will be determined by the technical and economic challenges.

## Schedule

The expectations from the students selecting this project is to deliver according to the following schedule (T0= the start date of the project):
