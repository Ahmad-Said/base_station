for vscode do the following:
install:

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client

and so disable other formatter and intellisense tool extensions.

run in terminal:

composer require --dev barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper
composer require --dev doctrine/dbal
php artisan ide-helper:generate
php artisan ide-helper:models

select no and restart vscode

after creating a model run again:
php artisan ide-helper:models
select no and restart vscode



Some time due to use of implicit function that return type of class that
intellisense could not detect automatically we can give it a hint using this structure:
/** @var MyClass $x */
