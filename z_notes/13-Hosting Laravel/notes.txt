install any sftp client (use filezilla or i used https://winscp.net/)
enter host server and client credentials
upload your host for the first time
your domain name (or sub domain if multiple web on server) should point to
/public folder.
set up database on server...
change .env file to match credentials.

download putty to access ssh (it's a secure shell that will run on server)
normally server use bash and ubuntu .. so get used to bash command and navigation..
most used command:
cd /usr/bin && ls    (will see what you can use)

php7.3 artisan .... whatever you want

git reset --hard (discard changes after last pull)
git pull   (update server after pushing an update)

command should be run on setup:
php7.3 artisan key:generate
rm public/storage
php7.3 artisan storage:link

defining new task weekly to check laravel jobs:
crontab -e
then add those lines at bottom:
#Laravel Update database
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

save the file and you should see: crontab: installing new crontab




Troubleshoot:
- if you get:
        Internal Server Error

        The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.

        Please contact the server administrator, and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error.

        More information about this error may be available in the server error log.

        Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.

- if you get some sort of server error from laravel command line or web interface
    that you don't get on your local machine especially with mysql commands (it may relate of using different version)
  ---> then to try solution write it on your local machine and upload it using sftp client to test it
    --> if it work then commit that change and push it.
    (that way commit keep clean and only commit and pull from server if there is a real update not minor fix separated
        at last sure will be a push/pull)
