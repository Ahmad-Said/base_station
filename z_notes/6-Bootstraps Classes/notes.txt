good tweak to navigate between files:
press ctrl + p   then name of the file
good to quick run command : f1
ctrl + p then @ to navigate in file functions
to navigate to folder like use ctrl + p /folder_name

also add this in setting json to show suggestion even in string:

"editor.quickSuggestions": {
        "other": true,
        "comments": true,
        "strings": true
    },

and to remove a class quickly redefine word separator in setting and like
i did  remove  tick - from separator to select hole class like btn-primary
in one click.
"editor.wordSeparators": "`~!@#$%^&*()=+[{]}\\|;:'\",.<>/?"
