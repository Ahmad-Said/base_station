This note is for branch beta_test

this is where we put our files then we merge them as a teamwork
that mean we will work on this branch commit our files update to this 
before pushing change to github to this branch make sure you did update
form the branch it self and the master branch
 
after a successful feature is ready we will merge into master branch
at first we will make sure to update from master to ensure that no conflict
then we will create a pull request to review code and changes 
then we will make a the merge operation between the branch ET Voila !
